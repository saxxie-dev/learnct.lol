In particular, it discusses 
      Categories and Type Theories as foundations for logics, connections with Structuralism and Semiotics, 
      and the philosophical implications of categorical models of science.`,stars:4.33,grUrl:"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35553023-categories-for-the-working-philosopher",amznUrl:"https://amzn.to/3zWuz18"},Scientist:{name:"Category Theory for the Sciences",author:"David Spivak",comment:`An introduction to methods for applying Categorical methods to scientific knowledge. It is deeply inspired
      by Spivak's extensive work relating Categories to Databases, and unusually for an introductory work, contains a
      discussion of Operads (which are usually encountered much later, despite being very useful.)
