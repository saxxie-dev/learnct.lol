A cute compilation of "Introduction to category theory for X"-type texts. Mainly books, but couple others in there as well.
Quality of said texts was not considered, only how well they matched the criteria and had a distinct profession associated with them.

## Contributing
Found a book or paper that matches the theme but isn't listed yet? Open an issue and I'll get around to it, probably.

## Developing

To start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output gets saved to `/docs`, from where `gh-pages` can serve it to viewers.
